    <h1>Privacy Policy for Promptemon: Unbound</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: January 4, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Promptemon: Unbound mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application" or "App") for mobile devices that was created by Pender Gaming (hereby referred to as "Service Provider" or "we", "us", "our") as a free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <p>Promptemon: Unbound is a location-based augmented reality game that uses AI to generate unique creatures based on your real-world location. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Due to the nature of Promptemon: Unbound as a location-based, multiplayer, AI-powered game, we collect certain information to provide and improve our services.</p>

    <h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> When you create an account using Firebase Authentication, we collect your email address (if provided) or anonymous authentication ID to identify your account and maintain your game progress.</li>
        <li><strong>User Profile Information:</strong> Display name, player level, currency balances (Chroma Prisms, Genesis Matrices), and gameplay statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your device's GPS coordinates are used to:
            <ul>
                <li>Generate location-specific creatures around you</li>
                <li>Display nearby spawn points and Loci on the map</li>
                <li>Enable territory control features</li>
                <li>Provide location-based gameplay experiences</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> Your creature collection, fusion history, inventory items, achievements, and gameplay actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Data:</strong> Friend connections, trading history, leaderboard rankings, and in-game communications with other players.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers for app functionality and analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Location Privacy:</strong> Your precise GPS coordinates are only used for gameplay purposes and are not shared with other players. Other players can only see your general presence in Loci (public locations) but not your exact position.
    </div>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Generate unique AI creatures based on your location, time of day, and environmental context</li>
        <li><strong>Multiplayer Features:</strong> Enable friend connections, creature trading, and competitive leaderboards</li>
        <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Maintain your profile, save game progress, and sync data across devices</li>
        <li><strong>Game Balance:</strong> Analyze gameplay data to improve creature generation, balance rarities, and enhance the gaming experience</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Send notifications about nearby creatures, friend requests, and game events</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Respond to your inquiries and resolve technical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>Firebase Cloud Services</h3>
    <p>Promptemon: Unbound uses Google Firebase as our backend infrastructure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Securely manages user accounts and authentication</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Firestore:</strong> Stores your game data, creature collections, and social interactions in a secure, encrypted database</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Storage:</strong> Stores AI-generated creature images securely</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS and at rest using Google's security infrastructure. Firebase complies with major privacy regulations including GDPR and CCPA.</p>
    <p>For more information about Firebase's security practices, visit: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></p>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>The Application also stores certain data locally on your device using SharedPreferences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Cached game data for offline viewing</li>
        <li>Last known location (for quick app startup)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage</h2>
    <p>Promptemon: Unbound uses Google's Gemini AI to generate unique creatures. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What We Send:</strong> We send your current location context (location type, time of day, biome) and desired creature rarity to Google's Gemini API</li>
        <li><strong>What We Receive:</strong> AI-generated creature names, descriptions, types, stats, and moves</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> No personally identifiable information is sent to the AI service. Location context is generalized (e.g., "urban park at night" rather than precise coordinates)</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Google's AI service does not store or use your prompts to train their models (based on our API tier)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information about Google's AI data practices, visit: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank">https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms</a></p>

    <h2>Image Generation Services</h2>
    <p>Creature images are generated using third-party AI image generation services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pollinations.ai (Free Tier):</strong> Default provider for generating creature images. Images are generated via public API and may be cached by the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Premium Providers:</strong> Players can optionally configure DALL-E or Stability AI with their own API keys for higher quality images.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Image prompts sent to these services contain creature descriptions but no personal information.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements within the Application. AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized ads, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, operating system version)</li>
        <li>Advertising ID</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>App interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information about how Google uses data, please review Google's Privacy Policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    <p>You can opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device's ad settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Google Maps Platform</h3>
    <p>The Application uses Google Maps to display the game map and your location. Google Maps may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Map interactions (zoom, pan, searches)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Maps data usage is governed by Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h2>Location Permissions</h2>
    <div class="important">
        <strong>Location Access:</strong> Promptemon: Unbound requires access to your device's location to function. The app will request location permissions when you first launch it.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Why We Need It:</strong> Location data is essential for generating creatures around you, displaying the game map, and enabling territory-based features</li>
        <li><strong>When We Access It:</strong> Location is accessed continuously while the app is in use</li>
        <li><strong>How to Control It:</strong> You can revoke location permissions in your device settings, but this will prevent the game from functioning properly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Multiplayer and Social Features</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Friend System:</strong> Friend requests and connections are stored to enable social gameplay</li>
        <li><strong>Trading:</strong> Trade history (creatures exchanged, participants, timestamps) is recorded</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Your display name, level, and statistics may be visible to other players in leaderboards</li>
        <li><strong>Public Loci:</strong> Your presence in public Loci may be visible to nearby players (without revealing your exact location)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can control your social visibility through in-game settings.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
