    <h1>Privacy Policy for Six-Minute Saga</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: January 5, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Six-Minute Saga mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application" or "App") for mobile devices that was created by Pender Gaming (hereby referred to as "Service Provider" or "we", "us", "our") as a free service with optional in-app purchases. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <p>Six-Minute Saga is an AI-powered interactive story generator that creates unique narrative adventures based on your choices. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <li><strong>Purchase History:</strong> Records of credit packs and theme pack purchases (processed by Google Play).</li>
        <li><strong>Theme Pack Ownership:</strong> Which theme packs (Sci-Fi, Horror, History) you have purchased.</li>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>No Personal Identification Required:</strong> Six-Minute Saga does not require you to create an account or provide any personally identifiable information such as name, email, or phone number to play the game.
    </div>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Story Generation:</strong> Create unique AI-generated narratives based on your character, setting, and goal choices</li>
        <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Save your saga library, credit balance, and gameplay progress locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Remember your preferences and settings</li>

        <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Process in-app purchases and deliver rewarded ad credits</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Respond to your inquiries and resolve technical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>

    <h3>Local Device Storage</h3>
    <p>The Application stores most data locally on your device using SharedPreferences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your saga library (completed stories)</li>
        <li>Credit balance and purchase history</li>
        <li>Theme pack ownership</li>
        <li>Daily bonus claim timestamps</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you uninstall the app, this local data will be deleted and cannot be recovered.</p>

    <h3>Firebase Cloud Services</h3>
    <p>Six-Minute Saga uses Google Firebase for analytics and remote configuration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the game</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Remote Config:</strong> Allows us to adjust game parameters (credit prices, daily bonuses) without requiring app updates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All Firebase data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS and at rest using Google's security infrastructure. Firebase complies with major privacy regulations including GDPR and CCPA.</p>
    <p>For more information about Firebase's security practices, visit: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></p>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage</h2>
    <p>Six-Minute Saga uses Google's Gemini AI to generate unique story content. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What We Send:</strong> Your selected character, setting, goal, previous story text, and your choice from the last chapter</li>
        <li><strong>What We Receive:</strong> AI-generated story chapters (approximately 100 words) and two choices for the next chapter</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> No personally identifiable information is sent to the AI service. Only game-related context is shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> According to Google's API terms, prompts and outputs may be retained for up to 24 hours for abuse detection, but are not used for model training</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information about Google's AI data practices, visit: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank">https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms</a></p>

    <p>Story images are generated using third-party AI image generation services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Replicate.com (Optional):</strong> When enabled, creature images are generated via Replicate's Stable Diffusion API</li>
        <li><strong>Default Placeholders:</strong> If image generation is disabled, stylized placeholder images are used instead</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Image generation prompts contain only story descriptions and no personal information. These services may cache generated images according to their terms of service.</p>
