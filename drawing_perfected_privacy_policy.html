    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Drawing Perfected mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application" or "App") for mobile devices that was created by our development team (hereby referred to as "Service Provider" or "we", "us", "our") as a free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information from users. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe creative experience.</p>

    <h3>What We Do NOT Collect</h3>

        <li>Personal information (name, email address, phone number, etc.)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers beyond what is required for basic app functionality</li>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>The Application stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your settings and preferences (such as color choices, brush sizes, and drawing tool preferences) are saved locally using SharedPreferences to provide a consistent experience across sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cached Images:</strong> When you select images from online sources (Art Institute of Chicago or Met Museum APIs), they are temporarily processed on your device to create outlines. These images are not stored permanently or transmitted to any servers.</li>
        <li><strong>All of this data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any servers.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Device Permissions</h3>
    <p>The Application requests the following permissions to function properly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To allow you to take photos that can be converted into drawing outlines. Photos are processed locally and not uploaded anywhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library/Gallery:</strong> To allow you to select existing photos from your device to trace. Selected photos remain on your device and are not uploaded.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> To fetch artwork images from the Art Institute of Chicago and Metropolitan Museum of Art public APIs, and to display advertisements.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save your completed drawings to your device's gallery when you choose to save them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and no data from these permissions is transmitted to third parties except as described in the Third-Party Services section below.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>

    <h3>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</h3>

        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking</li>
    </ul>

Please refer to the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Met Museum's terms and conditions</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <li>Accesses the device camera and photo library (only when explicitly granted permission)</li>
        <li>Downloads artwork images from public museum APIs</li>

    <ul>
