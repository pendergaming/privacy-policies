    <h1>Privacy Policy for Hearts</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        Hearts is designed with your privacy in mind. The app itself does not collect, store, or transmit

        <li>User preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Game progress and state</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain information
        as described in Google's Privacy Policy. This may include:

        For more information about how Google uses data, please visit
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and
        <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob's Privacy Information</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising Controls</h2>
    <p>
        You can control personalized advertising on your device through your device settings:

        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The game is designed
        to be family-friendly and safe for all ages. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child
        has provided us with personal information, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect personal information, there is minimal security risk. Game data stored on
        your device is protected by your device's security measures.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting
        the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
