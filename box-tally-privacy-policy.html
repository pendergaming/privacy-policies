    <h1>Privacy Policy for Box Tally</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: December 3, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Box Tally mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application" or "App") for mobile devices that was created by our development team (hereby referred to as "Service Provider" or "we", "us", "our") as a free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application uses Firebase services to enable core functionality including user authentication and data synchronization. We collect and process the following information:</p>

    <h3>What We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> When you use the app, we create an anonymous identifier to associate your data with your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Display Name:</strong> The name you choose to identify yourself within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Box and Item Data:</strong> Information about boxes and items you create, including names, descriptions, locations, categories, and estimated values.</li>
        <li><strong>Household Data:</strong> Information about households you create or join, including the household name and member list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Do NOT Collect</h3>

        <li>Photos from your camera roll (unless you explicitly upload item photos)</li>
        <li>Contacts or address book</li>
        <li>Payment or financial information</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>Your data is stored in Google Firebase Cloud Firestore, a secure cloud database service. This allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your box inventory from multiple devices</li>
        <li>Share your household with family members</li>
        <li>Keep your data synchronized in real-time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>

    <h3>Google Firebase</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase for authentication and data storage. Firebase may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information for analytics</li>
        <li>App performance data</li>
        <li>Crash reports to help us improve the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information, please review Firebase's Privacy Policy at: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></p>

    <h3>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements within the Application, including banner ads and rewarded video ads. AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized ads, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, operating system version)</li>
        <li>Advertising ID</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>App interaction data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device's ad settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings > Privacy > Tracking > Allow Apps to Request to Track</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rewarded Advertisements</h2>
    <p>The Application offers optional rewarded video advertisements that, when watched, provide additional storage capacity (more boxes or items per box). Viewing these ads is entirely voluntary. The rewarded ads are provided by Google AdMob and are subject to their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your box and item data may be shared with other members of your household if you choose to invite them using your household's share code. This is an intentional feature to allow families to collaborate on packing and moving.</p>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties except as described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Application is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary action.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in using our Application. Your data is protected by Firebase's security infrastructure, which includes encryption in transit and at rest. Access to your household data is restricted to authenticated members only.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as you maintain an active account. If you wish to delete your data, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Leave a household (removes your membership)</li>
        <li>Contact us to request account deletion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
