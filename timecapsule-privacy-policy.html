    <h1>Time Capsule - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 17, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Time Capsule ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> Time Capsule stores all your capsule content (text messages, photos, voice notes, and files) locally on your device. This data is never uploaded to our servers or any cloud service.</p>
    <p><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information for ad personalization, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Usage data for ad optimization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your capsule content (messages, photos, voice notes, files) remains entirely on your device and is used solely to provide the time capsule functionality you expect from the app.</p>
    <p>Advertising data is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display relevant advertisements</li>
        <li>Measure ad performance</li>
        <li>Support the free version of the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All your capsule content is stored in a secure, sandboxed area of your device that other apps cannot access. We do not have access to your content as it never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For displaying advertisements. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p><strong>Ad Tracking:</strong> On iOS, you can opt out of personalized advertising through your device's App Tracking Transparency settings. On Android, you can opt out through your device's advertising settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete any capsule and its associated content at any time within the app. Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data.</p>

    <p>Time Capsule is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
