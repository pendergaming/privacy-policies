    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Tile Tango mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application" or "App") for mobile devices that was created by our development team (hereby referred to as "Service Provider" or "we", "us", "our") as a free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
