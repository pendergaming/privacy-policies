    <h1>Privacy Policy for Evo: Your AI Companion</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: January 5, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the Evo: Your AI Companion mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application" or "App") for mobile devices that was created by Pender Gaming (hereby referred to as "Service Provider" or "we", "us", "our") as a free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <p>Evo: Your AI Companion is a personal AI companion app that evolves based on your conversations. Your Evo develops unique personality traits, learns from your interactions, and provides companionship through AI-powered conversations. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Evo: Your AI Companion is designed with privacy in mind. We minimize data collection and store most information locally on your device.</p>

    <h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Your Evo's name, conversation history with your companion, and any custom settings you configure.</li>
        <li><strong>Companion Data:</strong> Your Evo's personality traits, energy levels, evolution history, visual customizations, and statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Inventory Data:</strong> Virtual currency balance (coins), owned cosmetic items, and purchase history for in-app items.</li>
        <li><strong>API Configuration:</strong> If you configure your own AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, or Ollama), your API keys are stored securely on your device using encrypted storage. We never have access to your API keys.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, and app version for compatibility and troubleshooting purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Privacy First:</strong> All conversation data and companion information is stored LOCALLY on your device. We do not have access to your conversations, your Evo's personality, or any personal data unless you choose to use external AI services.
    </div>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Companion Experience:</strong> Generate your Evo's personality traits, visual appearance, and responses based on your interactions</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Save your companion's state, conversation history, and progress on your device</li>
        <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> Maintain settings, preferences, and customizations you select</li>
        <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Track virtual currency (coins) earned and spent within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Home Screen Widget:</strong> Display your Evo's current status on your device's home screen</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>Local Device Storage</h3>
    <p>Evo: Your AI Companion stores data locally on your device using:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SharedPreferences:</strong> Stores your Evo's state, conversation history, personality data, inventory, and app settings</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Storage (flutter_secure_storage):</strong> Encrypts and stores your API keys if you configure external AI services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers. If you uninstall the app, all local data is deleted.</p>

    <h3>Memory Tiers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> Conversation messages older than 24 hours are automatically deleted from your device to manage storage. Your Evo's personality and stats are always retained.</li>
        <li><strong>Evo Plus (Premium):</strong> Permanent message storage - all conversations are kept indefinitely on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage</h2>
    <p>Evo: Your AI Companion uses AI services to generate your companion's conversational responses. Here's how it works:</p>

    <h3>Your Choice of AI Provider</h3>
    <p>You can configure the app to use one of the following AI services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI (ChatGPT):</strong> Requires your own OpenAI API key</li>

        <li><strong>Google (Gemini):</strong> Requires your own Google AI API key</li>
        <li><strong>Cohere:</strong> Requires your own Cohere API key</li>
        <li><strong>Ollama (Self-Hosted):</strong> Connects to your own local AI server</li>
        <li><strong>Mock AI (Default):</strong> Uses pre-generated responses without any external service</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Important:</strong> When you use external AI services, your conversations are sent to the respective AI provider according to YOUR API key. We do not control or have access to this data. Please review the privacy policies of your chosen AI provider.
    </div>
